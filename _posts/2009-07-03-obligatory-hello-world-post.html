<p><strong>Welcome to the new thomasjbradley.ca!</strong> It’s pretty frakin’ amazing, eh? Well it should be, it took me a good two years of re-designing and re-coding to build—but more on that soon.</p>
<p>This is just one of those quick posts that every new blog <em>must</em> have, so I can tell you what this web site is about—though I’m pretty sure you already know.</p>
<p>Here’s the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Thomas J Bradley makes web sites that are elegant, simple <span class="amp">&amp;</span> absolutely super-duper!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Whoa, this site’s about me!</strong></p>
<p>Now something a little more interesting. What the blog is about, represented by another official description:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Articles, essays and tips &amp; tricks on topics including web development, web education and Canadiana.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Under Construction</h2>
<p>The site is, unfortunately, not complete. Though after two years you’d think it would be! I had wanted to launch with three blog posts, but was so excited to launch my site I thought I would write them over the next three days.</p>
<p>There are a few other things I would like to do, but this site will be more of an ongoing project instead of a make-it-and-leave-it type deal like version one-point-zero.</p>
<p>Since everything is official today, here is the <em>official</em> list of incomplete things (which will get done in the next few days), copied directly from the text file on my desktop.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Oh, and a bazillion other details.</strong></p>

<p>Anyways, I think that’s all. Let me know what you think of the site! Hopefully you love it as much as I do.</p>
