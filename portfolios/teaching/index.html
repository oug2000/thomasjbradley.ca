      <p>I believe that everybody should perpetually learn, try, build, break, and fix things. In the ever-changing interactive field, learning is an important skill; I want to inspire the passion for learning and creating in others. As a twenty-first and a half century professor, I have two major roles: curator and mentor.</p>
      <details>
        <summary><span>Read my whole teaching philosophy…</span></summary>

        <div class="details-inside">
          <h3>Curator</h3>
          <p>We now carry the sum of human knowledge in our pockets. And as amazing as that is, there is still a major problem: we carry the sum of human knowledge in our pockets—that’s a lot of stuff.</p>
          <p>With that much stuff it’s daunting to determine which information is relevant, up-to-date, and correct. With fast-paced interactive practices, the problems are compounded. Information gets out-dated really quickly, best practices change rapidly, there’s incorrect details, and huge amounts of knowledge.</p>
          <p>When tackling a new topic I browse, read, and try many different resources. Books, tutorials, articles, magazines, code; anything to help me understand. My learning process is funnel-like. I gather countless pieces of information: wrong pieces, right pieces, old pieces, new pieces, contradictory pieces, best practices, out-dated practices—anything that seems relevant—and I funnel it into a cohesive understanding.</p>
          <p>As an educator, I believe it’s my job to help the students by funnelling the sum of human knowledge and simplifying their information gathering. I point my students to the most appropriate resources for a specific topic. For the interactive field, generally those resources are online because books become old quickly—though I recognize books are helpful for many learners. </p>
          <p>In the interactive field there is so much to know, even after funnelling the information, it can still be overwhelming. We all need reminders of the material and I aim to have the material available to the students online, so they can refer to it inside, and outside, the classroom as needed.</p>

          <h3>Mentor</h3>
          <p>Humans learn at different speeds and in different ways and I strive to help each learner the way that is best for them. As a mentor I can understand each individual’s world view and uniquely tailor the learning experience.</p>
          <p>As a teacher in the interactive field, it’s important to follow and understand all the best practices and know when and how to use them. Having a T-shaped knowledge of the interactive field allows me to guide students down the path that is uniquely appropriate and helpful.</p>
          <p>Knowledge experiences don’t always happen in the classroom and I encourage students to learn through the exploration of practical examples that portray a specific skill or piece of information critical to a thorough understanding. I want everyone to get as much knowledge—and experience—as they want, and I do so by providing supplemental resources and direction for students as a group and individually.</p>
          <p>It’s important to guide learners to the answer of their problems not give them the answer; breaking things and fixing things is an important learning process. I want to give students the tools they need and point them in the right direction.</p>

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>I believe that I should give students knowledge blocks that they can rearrange and piece together into a cohesive whole. Like Lego, I give the students small connecting pieces and they must use their knowledge and imagination to connect the pieces together and build something amazing.</p>
          <p>This strong foundation of blocks, coupled with the students’ imagination, encourages them to continue their learning outside the classroom. It promotes learners to explore and research the connections and expand their understanding using the learning style that is most effective for them.</p>
          <p>I strive to inspire the love for learning in everybody. Perpetual learning is important for the constant evolving interactive world.</p>

      <p>I built a couple fun, online games for my students to test their understanding of a few important topics. The materials were presented online through reading articles, videos, and experience using the tools. The tests were then administered in class.</p>

The game can be a little tricky because any mouse movement will trigger game over and force the user to start again.</p>
          <p>The test was light and fun and students really enjoyed it—even though it was difficult. One surprising experience was between students who were seated beside each other: one accidentally hit the other’s mouse, causing the game to restart. There was some light-hearted yelling and the class had a good laugh.</p>

      <p>Teaching web design and development presents an interesting challenge: the material is a moving target. Not only does the material need to be updated per term based on student feedback, but it also must be updated to reflect current industry trends and practices. <i>I actively follow and participate in the web community to make sure my materials are always relevant to the industry.</i></p>

        <div class="details-inside">
          <p>MTM 1519 Web Development, part of the Interactive Multimedia Program, is meant to introduce new learners to the World Wide Web and how to create interactive, usable, and accessible websites. It is primarily scoped as a code-based class, where students write markup and code to create their web projects.</p>

          <h3>First Time Teaching MTM 1519</h3>
          <p>In my first time teaching the course, Fall, 2010, I split the material into two main segments: HTML and CSS, & Javascript. The introduction of Javascript in the final third of the term was too drastic of a change making the material very difficult to grasp. My next iteration, Winter, 2011, dropped Javascript from the curriculum to concentrate on HTML and CSS. This ended up being more effective for the students by decreasing the amount of material for the term while allowing them to have more practice with HTML and CSS.</p>
          <p>During my first two runs of the course, HTML was segregated into two versions: XHTML and HTML5. At the time HTML5 wasn’t supported in enough browsers to be teaching as the sole version of HTML. Beginning in Fall, 2011, HTML5 is now the only version I teach.</p>

          <h3>More Low Level Material</h3>
          <p>From watching the students and understanding what aspects of programming were difficult, the assignments changed and adapted to their needs. I introduced a few more low-level–type assignments on understanding file paths and code organization. I originally had hoped the students would pick the material up from watching me use the techniques, but came to the realization that explanation and reinforcement was needed. The introduction of more low-level material was helpful to students at the beginning, but practice—and reminder—is still required.</p>

          <h3>More WordPress</h3>
          <p>Starting in Fall, 2011, the course made another large change: the introduction of WordPress into the curriculum. In the previous years the client projects became more geared towards providing content management systems and WordPress was the appropriate choice. Students were having to learn and implement WordPress themselves, so it was decided to include it in the course material.</p>
          <p>The introduction of WordPress presented a problem very similar to Javascript in the first go: there are almost two courses happening in the same term. I decided to introduce WordPress immediately after mid-term to provide enough time for a thorough understanding. WordPress is a complex and time-consuming product to implement and in attempting to prepare the students for their client projects, I introduced too many concepts the first time teaching it, confusing and frustrating the students. In the second time teaching it, Winter, 2012,  I reduced the material and the students now seem more engaged and even willing to do the extra material as bonus marks since it is now a choice instead of a requirement.</p>

          <h3>The Ever Evolving MTM 1519</h3>
          <p>I’m always updating, revising, and adapting the curriculum for MTM 1519 Web Development to maintain parity with the web industry, in hopes of preparing the students for a successful career.</p>

          <p>The requirements for the portfolio were technical, helping enforce the best practices learned throughout the term and allowing the students to explore content and design that is appropriate to them.

            <p>I think the portfolio site was one of the most important projects in the entire program because it's really important for designers to have websites. It made getting a field placement much easier and it continues to act as self promotion post-graduation. The process of coding a site from start to finish improved my skills to the point where I can now offer this service to clients. </p>
            <p>There’s not much I disliked about it. If anything I felt like the specs kept us from customizing our sites to our liking. Many people, myself included, redid our sites after this class. Specifically, I felt like there were an unnecessary amount of pages required. I later simplified mine down to one page — but this also helped to keep my skills up to date. </p>
            <p>Although it wasn’t required to make our sites responsive, I knew I wanted to do this and it was the biggest challenge. I overcame this challenge through extensive trial and error and by attending all the working classes to get feedback. </p>

        <summary><span><strong>Open Data App</strong>, by Trish Dupelle, Interactive Multimedia</span></summary>
        <div class="details-inside details-multi">
          <blockquote>
            <p>The open data application project was delivered by Professor Thomas Bradley in my second semester in the Interactive Multimedia Program at Algonquin College. In general, the project was a long but worthy process that was facilitated with Thomas’ extensive and patient help along the way.</p>
            <p>There are numerous reasons why I enjoyed this project; for starters, I truly am thankful for the fact that Thomas has this great ability to make all our class assignments build onto one another to develop a final product like our open data application. This way, every bit of hard work we put into our assignments will eventually be beneficial to our final project.</p>
            <p>More specifically to this project, I enjoyed seeing how JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL all collaborate together in a real-time application in both front-end and back-end manners. Additionally, the way Thomas breaks down each week into a specific lesson for a portion of our open data application was very beneficial for our beginner level of experience in web development (PHP, Javascript and MySQL in my case).</p>
            <p>I disliked very little of this project as any aspects that I may have disliked were due to other parameters such as time constraints of the program schedule.</p>
            <p>Some challenges I came across along the process of developing this application were typical and expected coming from someone inexperienced with other programming languages than HTML and CSS. Understanding the relationship between JavaScript, PHP and MySQL did create a struggle, but understanding and then being able to create JavaScript code from scratch was definitely my biggest challenge.  Luckily, as the weeks progressed, Thomas kept a copy of his in-class lessons where he followed along with a sample of the same application we were developing. This aspect of his teaching technique really helped me spot some missing code that an inexperienced eye would not catch or debug my application.</p>
            <p>Overall, I understand how effective and unique it will be to have such a particular piece on my portfolio and I would like to thank Thomas for his patience and knowledge in helping me develop my splendid splash pad locator, merci beaucoup!</p>

      <p>Feedback from learners is extremely important to improve and adapt the course for everybody. I encourage students to discuss any problems they are having with the materials and assignments so we can come up with something more appropriate and compatible with their learning styles.</p>

        <summary><span>Feedback reflection…</span></summary>
        <div class="details-inside">
          <p>There is one piece of feedback that consistently shows up and I struggle to fix it: I teach too quickly. Many of my lessons are centred around code tutorials, where students follow along and type the code samples on their own computers. The major challenge is that it’s difficult to keep pace with my typing while watching and listening.</p>
          <p>I’m actively trying many different approaches to accommodate everyone.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Take plenty of breaks between coding batches to allow people to catch-up.</li>
            <li>I try to provide the complete materials before and afterwards.</li>
            <li>I allow students to just listen and watch during class and type the code later.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The problem with some of these approaches is that it doesn’t encourage learners to retype the code, but re-typing code is extremely helpful in learning.</p>
