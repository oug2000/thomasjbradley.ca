          <p>Thomas went above and beyond my expectations. Not only was I blown away when he launched my website, but he was also a pleasure to work with. He was readily available at any time; came up with creative, unique solutions to any technical challenges we met; and walked me through the process in a clear, straightforward manner. He is now my go-to person for web development, and I wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone looking to launch a first-rate website.</p>

          <p>I am so lucky to have found Thomas to create my website! I am overjoyed with the finished product! He is very talented and creative, not to mention caring and very committed to excellent work. His programming skills and design savvy are unsurpassed—he can make anything happen!! He listened attentively to my specifications, then he created a design that is far better than I could have imagined! He was flexible, very professional and punctual throughout the whole process. I really can’t speak highly enough about Thomas; there is no need to look any farther for a web developer—he is the best out there!</p>

          <p>Thomas designed the website for Therapeutic Paws of Canada. A non-profit volunteer organization for pet therapy visits. The website needed to be re-built from scratch. Thomas completed the project in a timely manner and was a pleasure to work with in the development of the website. He captured the essence of our organization. The website is very appealing to potential volunteers and donors. Also the site is well structured for TPOC members. The organization is very pleased with the result. We would definitely use Thomas’ services again.</p>

          <p>Thomas was quick to grasp how I envisioned my site and he was happy to explain any technical questions I had about the whole process and made working together a breeze. I was both amazed and relieved how smoothly everything went and I’m frequently receiving positive comments about the site and was so delighted with the results!</p>
